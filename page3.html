			Over the course of a month my Mollies have recently been swimming odd much like a firm yet limp noodle, and after a few days since they started shimmying they started to die off. At the start I thought a dragonfly larvea had found its way into my water, but after a clean and inpection there was none to be found. After researching about the ailment and consulting other hobbyist, I've reached a conclusion to what has been causing it.

			<div class="contentInner">
				<span class="strong">CAUSE:</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				Since I was experimenting how rain water would affect my plant's growth, the acidity of my tank started to build up causing issues with my Mollies namely hindering their control over their nerves and muscle (<span class="smoll itally">Shimmies </span>).
				<br>
				<br>
				Shimmies itself isn't a single disease but rather a symptom, it occurs when when the fish is under severe stress usually cause by its environment.
			</div>
			<div class="contentInner">
				<span class="strong">POSSIBLE SOLUTION:</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				I am changing the water gradually and have been told by other hobbyist to add salt to the water to help fight off bacteria that may also damage and cause stress to the fish. 
				<br>
				<br>
				As of <span class="strong under">December 29, 2020</span> I have made the neccessary changes to the water quality and isolated another Molly in a sepparate tank as the control group. reports on the observations will be posted soon.

			</div>

			After months of selective breeding of Guppies and colony breeding of Mollies, I have noticed a problem from my breeding females. Their stomachs would deflate, they would almost be incapable of swimming and result to awkwardling wiggling in the water. They would also begin to act lethargic.

			<div class="contentInner">
				<span class="strong">CAUSE:</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				My research has lead be to believe that if a female has been continually bred by males they run the risk of having their ovaries popped out of their bodies, in my experience this has a 100% chance of death over 3 days even if the female fish has been isolated in a tank provided with plants and aeration. death has almost been certain in all these cases of overbreeding.
				
			</div>
			<div class="contentInner">
				<span class="strong">POSSIBLE SOLUTION:</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				I have been cycling through females, putting them in tanks with no males so that they can rest and so far this has caused me no issues. after 2 - 3 breeding sessions I would segregate the previously pregnant female to a all female tank.
				<br>
				<br>
				As of <span class="strong under">December 29, 2020</span> There have been no cases of death via overbreeding.
